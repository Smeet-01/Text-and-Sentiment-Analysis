# Text_Analysis
The program constructed here extracts the texts from blogs and analyzes the same to obtain certain metrics to understand the content in the blog better. 
The program is built using Python with certain assumed prerequisites. 


1. It is assumed that the URLs of the blogs to be used are stored in an .xlsx file which is imported in the program using pandas 

2. The output obtained from web-scraping is stored in .txt files titled 1 to (n). 

3. The stop-words to be used are obtained from .txt files and stored as a dictionary. 

4. The output obtained from the metric analysis is stored into a dataframe and exported to a .xlsx file.
